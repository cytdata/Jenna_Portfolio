## 1- Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from 2020 to 2023, highlighting how I identified key challenges in the earlier years and implemented strategic improvements in 2023. By conducting an in-depth analysis of key performance indicators, I uncovered specific pain points that impacted sales performance. Based on these insights, I developed and executed targeted strategies to address these issues, leading to measurable improvements. To ensure data confidentiality, I created a synthetic dataset that accurately represents my personal sales performance.
