# Customer Base Optimization & Growth Strategy
**2020-2023 Analysis & Strategies**

## 1- Project Background
The main purpose of this project is to identify patterns to enhance sales performance. Examining data from 2020 to 2023, I discovered the crucial factors driving revenue growth, and implemented strategic improvements in 2023. As a result, I demonstrated the deep impact of the strategies and remarkable results. To ensure data confidentiality, I created a synthetic dataset to represent my personal sales performance.

## 2- Dataset Overview

#### 2-1 Dataset
To present my personal sales performance in 2023, I created two datasets: one containing historical data from 2020 to 2022, and the other showing the 2023 results based on historical data analysis. Through analyzing this data, I significantly improved sales performance using key performance indicators. To protect sensitive information, I created a synthetic dataset that includes key variables such as date, lead list, sales revenue and descriptive information.

#### 2-2 Data Structure

**Data Structure**
- Rows: 833
- Columns: 15

**Key Features**  
`customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.  
`role_status`: Current role of the customer (e.g. student, employed, unemployed).  
`education`: Highest degree earned or current academic standing.  
`test_score`: Exam score or assessment result.  
`purpose`: Reason for initial consultation.  
`by_channel`: Source of customer lead.  
`consultation_date`: Date of the first consultation.  
`conversion_status`: Current enrollment status (e.g. enrolled, unenrolled).  
`order_date`: Date of enrollment.  
`sales`: Total revenue received from the student.  
`non_conversion_reason`: Reason for non-conversion.

#### 2-3 Key Objectives  
1. Utilize Excel for data collection and cleaning; build graphics and create interactive dashboards using Tableau.
2. Increase source list volume and resolve problems during off-season.
3. Focus on non-converting groups and enhance conversion rates through implemented measures.
4. Compare different sources and expand lists with higher conversion rates.
5. Analyze education levels to identify reasons for unenrollment and develop targeted strategies for different academic backgrounds.

## 3- Executive Summary
Based on the chart, a decline in sales was observed during the first half of 2020. Analysis revealed that the primary reason was the disproportionately high percentage of students in the customer base, which created an imbalance due to seasonal fluctuations. The main solution is to increase the proportion of employed customers as a priority task to balance out seasonal effects.Although 'referral by friends' and 'repeat purchases' show higher conversion rates, both sources have the lowest number of people. The strategy should be modified to build lead lists in the CRM system to increase membership numbers. Additionally, we should monitor membership status and analyze patterns to understand what drives repeat purchases.According to data, 20.5% of non-conversions are due to customers cannot afford the products. To address this, we should provide more payment method options such as Line Pay and JKO Pay, and extend the monthly loan periods to reduce customers' financial pressure.Junior and senior college students show a higher proportion of responses indicating they are 'not ready to face' or have 'no immediate needs'. However, since they will soon face graduate school entrance exams or employment, they actually have higher potential needs. After discussing with supervisors, this situation will be improved.

In 2023, we tracked our progress weekly and discussed with various departments about increasing both customer numbers and sales of different digital products. The results show rapid growth in 'referral by friends' and 'repeat purchases' categories. The overall list increased by 47%, with an impressive conversion rate of 4.4%, achieving a remarkable 66.4% surge in sales revenue, significantly outperforming the previous year.
