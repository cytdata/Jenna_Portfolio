# Sales Performance Optimization: 2020-2023 Analysis & Strategies

## 1- Project Background
The main purpose of this project is to identify patterns to enhance sales performance. Examining data from 2020 to 2023, I discovered the crucial factors driving revenue growth, and implemented strategic improvements in 2023. As a result, I demonstrated the deep impact of the strategies and remarkable results. To ensure data confidentiality, I created a synthetic dataset to represent my personal sales performance.

## 2- Dataset Overview

#### 2-1 Dataset
To present my personal sales performance in 2023, I created two datasets: one containing historical data from 2020 to 2022, and the other showing the 2023 results based on historical data analysis. Through analyzing this data, I significantly improved sales performance using key performance indicators. To protect sensitive information, I created a synthetic dataset that includes key variables such as date, lead list, sales revenue and descriptive information.
